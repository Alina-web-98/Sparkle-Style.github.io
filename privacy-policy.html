            <p class="tetx-privacy-policy">We recognize the importance of privacy. This document describes what personal information we collect and collect when you use the site. We hope that this information will help you make informed decisions regarding the personal information we provide.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Public Information<br/></span>If you simply browse the site without registering, information about you is not published on the site. When you write or edit materials on the site, you publish every word of what you wrote, and this information will be stored and shown to other visitors to the project. This applies to articles, useful tips, materials, user personal pages, comments, etc.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Visitor Identification<br/></span>You can register on the site, but you can not register. If you register, you will be identified by your member name. This may be your real name (if you want it) or you may prefer to publish under a pseudonym - the name that you introduced when creating the account. Other registered visitors to the site will be able to see the data you provided during registration.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">E-mail<br/></span>The e-mail address you provided during registration is not shown to other visitors to the site. We can save e-mail messages and other letters sent by users in order to process user questions, respond to inquiries and improve our services.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Cookie<br/></span>When you visit the site, one or more cookies are sent to your computer. This is a small file that contains character sets and allows you to identify the browser. When you register on the site, additional cookies may be sent to your computer to avoid re-entering your username (and possibly password) on your next visit. You can erase them at the end of the session if you use a public computer and do not want to open your nickname to subsequent computer users (in which case you also need to clear the browser cache). We use cookies to improve the quality of our services by saving user settings and tracking trends in user actions, for example, when performing a search. Most browsers are initially set up so to accept cookies, however, you can completely prohibit the use of cookies or set up notifications about sending them. However, without cookies, some site features may not work properly.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Logging<br/></span>Every time you visit a site, our servers automatically record information that your browser transmits when you visit web pages. Typically, this information includes the requested web page, computer IP address, browser type, browser language settings, date and time of the inquiry, as well as one or more cookies that allow you to accurately identify your browser.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Links<br/></span>On this site, links can be in a format that allows you to track whether visitors use them. This information is used to improve the quality of our advertising.<br/><br/><span class="text-bold">Changes to the privacy policy<br/></span>Please note that the privacy policy is subject to periodic changes. All changes to the privacy policy are published on this page.</p>
